# under-the-same-sky

A mobile application to connect members of remotely distributed families by depicting the sky where each family member is currently located.

Initially, the application will support the scenario of a toddler and grandparent viewing and exchanging sky decorations, such as sending each other balloons, kites, UFOs, planes, or adding stars to the night sky. The sky, its elements, and decorations can be very simple drawings.

To support older children, the sky images will appear more realistic to include constellations and to indicate where the sun or moon is in the sky.

## Minimum Use Case: Supporting Default Locations

Upon launching the application, 6 images appear representing the default locations supported:

- London
- NYC
- San Francisco
- Tokyo
- Sydney, Australia
- Bangalore, India

If a user selects one of the cities, an image of the sky depicting current conditions appears. Current conditions include daylight and weather.
For example, if a user selects London and the current time in London is 08:00 GMT and it is a sunny day, the screen will show a blue sky and a bright sun. If the time is 22:00 GMT and the night is clear, the screen will show a night sky with a moon

## Admin Use Cases

An admin UI will need to be created to set up user profiles and possibly manage accounts if the application is monetized or security settings implemented.

### Profiles

A bare minimum profile will have a participant name and location.
Stretch goal: allow an admin to upload an image of multiple participants
Stretch goal: allow a participant to manage user name, image, and location for self

## Notifications

Participants will receive notifications when someone has decorated their sky.
